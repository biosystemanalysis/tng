make


Test by running:
bin/tng_testing

No system wide installations are made yet (no 'make install'), which means that
programs using the library must specify explicitly where to look for it.


Useful cmake flags:
-DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON to build the API documentation (requires doxygen)
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to compile with debug flags (recommended for
feedback during development)
-DBUILD_FORTRAN=ON to build the Fortran MD simulations example, saving results
in the TNG format (requires a Fortran compiler allowing cray-pointers).
