Test by running:
bin/tng_testing

No system wide installations are made yet (no 'make install'), which means that
programs using the library must specify explicitly where to look for it.

(currently 'bin/tng_testing' requires a tng_example.tng in the directory
 the command is invoked. This will be fixed soon:

 cp ../example_files/tng_example.tng .

 )
